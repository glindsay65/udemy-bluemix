# Static Resume
This is the source code for the tutorial application associated with the "IBM Bluemix Application Development" [course on Udemy]().

This is the initial and _static version_ of the resume application. There is no dynamic content or database associated with this version.  It is pure HTML and CSS only, although Bootstrap 4.0 is used. 

The static resume can be run locally or uploaded to IBM Bluemix and run from there.

Throughout the course, we will expand and build on this initial version.
